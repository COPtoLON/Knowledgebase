# Rough Paths and Signature Methods in Machine Learning

Rough path theory brings a robust suite of tools to the table for use in stochastic analysis and machine learning with applications wide-spread. The main strength lies in the signature which is a sequence of iterated integrals. There exist a linear functional on the space of signature paths that makes linear regression one the most powerful tools if combined with RNN-based controlled differential equation (CDE) solvers. Rough path theory and signature methods have seen a multitude of applications, most notably within Chinese handwritten character recognition and time series prediction.
