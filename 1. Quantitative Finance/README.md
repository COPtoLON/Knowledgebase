Quantitative finance, often referred to as "quant finance," is a multidisciplinary field at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and financial theory. It focuses on the development and application of sophisticated mathematical models and computational techniques to analyze financial markets, manage risks, and optimize investment strategies. This field plays a critical role in modern finance, enabling institutions to price complex derivatives, forecast market trends, and develop algorithmic trading systems. As financial markets become increasingly data-driven, quantitative finance continues to evolve, leveraging advancements in machine learning, big data analytics, and high-performance computing to address the growing complexity and speed of global trading environments.

## Areas of Quantitative finance
The links associated with each subject will take you to their respective area pages, which will go into depth with each of the areas.
If you're just starting out these won't be relevant for you yet. Take a look at the general subject network and books, videos and repositories further down, after reading a bit about each of the areas you find interesting.

#### [Derivatives]()
Description: Focuses on valuing financial derivatives (e.g., options, futures, and swaps) and managing the risks associated with them.
Methods: Stochastic calculus, numerical methods (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations), and partial differential equations.
#### [Trading]()
Description: Involves designing automated trading strategies that execute trades at high speeds based on quantitative models.
Focus Areas: Market microstructure, statistical arbitrage, and real-time decision-making.
9. Statistical Arbitrage
Description: Identifies market inefficiencies and exploits them through statistical models.
Tools: Time series analysis, pair trading, and machine learning.
#### [Portfolio management]()
Description: Uses mathematical techniques to allocate assets efficiently to maximize returns for a given level of risk.
Frameworks: Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), mean-variance optimization, and factor models.
6. Quantitative Investment Strategies
Description: Develops systematic investment strategies based on quantitative models.
Popular Strategies: Momentum investing, factor investing, and machine learning-driven approaches.
#### [Risk management]()
Description: Quantifies and mitigates financial risks such as market risk, credit risk, and operational risk.
Key Metrics: Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR, and stress testing.
#### [Fixed Income and Interest Rates]()
Description: Focuses on pricing and managing risks in fixed-income securities like bonds.
Models: Yield curve modeling, term structure models (e.g., Vasicek, CIR), and credit spread analysis.
#### [Credit]()
Description: Assesses the likelihood of default and models credit events for corporate bonds, loans, and other credit-sensitive instruments.
Applications: Credit scoring, default probability estimation, and collateralized debt obligation (CDO) pricing.
#### [Machine Learning and AI in Finance]()
Description: Applies AI techniques to improve forecasting, trading, and risk assessment.

Description: Focuses on modeling and managing risks in energy markets and commodities like oil, gas, and metals.
Techniques: Stochastic modeling, optimization, and real options analysis.
#### [Financial Engineering]()
Description: Designs new financial products and structures, such as exotic derivatives and securitization frameworks.
Focus: Combining creativity with mathematical rigor to meet market demands.
#### [Behavioral and Experimental Finance]()
Description: Studies the influence of human behavior on financial markets using quantitative tools.
Overlap: Bridges traditional finance with psychology and data science.
#### [Quantitative Research and Strategy]()
Description: Involves creating models to identify patterns, predict market movements, and guide decision-making.
#### [Cryptocurrency and Blockchain]()
Description: Applies quantitative methods to analyze digital assets, tokenomics, and blockchain technology.
