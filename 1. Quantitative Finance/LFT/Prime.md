0. Build your ideal state strategy. Where if in this state you will earn as much as possible.
1. Detect market state and opponent positions. - Because in general you're just playing against the market, but you're also playing against specific opponents.
2. Match market state with tactic to progress towards strategic goal points. - For each market state, there's a series of actions you can perform to go to your ideal state.
3. Decide on counter-measure or alignment-measure. - Depending on whether you're progressing towards your ideal state or moving away, you can take actions to move towards it again.
   a. If counter-measure, decide on size, direction, time and method
   b. If alignment-measure, decide on size, direction, time and method.
6. Proceed to optimal execution, considering market impact, timing and cost. - To best progress towards your ideal state, you can try to minimize cost or consider the best steps.

## Macrostrategic improvements

1. Run Leveraged trades
2. Run options, futures and swaps
3. Run multiple asset types: Crypto, equity, derivatives, commodities









## Detect Market state

* What is the current trend state?\
**Question:**\
How precise is the mean return functional at detecting the trend?\
How precise is the positive-negative functional at detecting the trend?\
How precise is the battery of statistical tests at detecting the trend?


* What is the current risk state?\
**Question:**\
What's the current volatility states?\
What's the current connectability in the market?\
What are the current probability states?

* Has an extremal event occured?\
**Question:**\
How precise is Bollinger bands of 1.5, 2 or 2.5 sigma at detecting Extremal events?\
How precise is the 10%, 5% and 1% quantile of xyz-interval returns at detecting Extremal events?\
How precise is the 10%, 5% and 1% quantile of xyz-interval prices at detecting Extremal events?




## Match corresponding strategy

* If Up trend:\
*run long between 0-tangents, to minimize risk of loss*

1. Check for Extremal events \
   If Negative Extremal event occurs - Close trades, take loss. Halt trading\
   If Positive Extremal event occurs - Close trades, take profit. Gauge trading
2. Check for Divergence and weight of closed trades.\
   If open, high and low diverge over time.\
   Consider whether a high volatility period is ahead and how to benefit on buying low and selling high.\
   If the the weight of the closing trades are significant and a certain direction has been chosen.\
   Consider whether to play along the direction or to take profit before a direction change.
3. Check for moment and moment drift

* If Down trend:\
*run short between 0-tangets, to minimize risk of loss*

1. Check for Extremal events \
   If Negative Extremal event occurs - Close trades, take loss. Halt trading\
   If Positive Extremal event occurs - Close trades, take profit. Gauge trading
2. Check for Divergence and weight of closed trades.\
   If open, high and low diverge over time.\
   Consider whether a high volatility period is ahead and how to benefit on buying low and selling high.\
   If the the weight of the closing trades are significant and a certain direction has been chosen.\
   Consider whether to play along the direction or to take profit before a direction change.
3. Check for moment and moment drift

* If Flat trend:\
*run long between 0-tangents, to minimize risk of loss*\
*run short between 0-tangets, to minimize risk of loss*

1. Check for mean reversion indications\
   If the 6, 20 and 40 day moving averages cross\
   If the average directional index changes\
   If the trend indicators change\
   If the autocorrelation indicator increases
2. Check for Resistance levels
   If the Price reaches a previous resistance level - concrete price
   If the price reaches a fibonacci level - mythical & mystical price level
   If the price drops by x% from a previous max or min
3. Check for Breakthrough signals
   *Unsure how to check this at the moment*

* If unknown trend:\
*Wait till a clear trend manifests*
