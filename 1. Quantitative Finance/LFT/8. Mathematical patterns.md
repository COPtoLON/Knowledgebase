#### Strategy 1 - [link](https://algocraft.xyz/how-to-get-131-return-with-mean-reversion-trading-strategy-from-stock-selection-to-backtesting-c623870adf31)

Calculate the 30-SMA and 30-MSTD of your close prices.
The A-factor has been set to 1%

**Note:** For this strategy 30-SMA = sum(prices(max[0, i - 30]:i) / min(i, 30) \
**Buy:** Close price < ma[-1] * (1 - A) \
**Sell:** Close price > ma[-1] * (1 + A)


#### Strategy 2

For this strategy you should calculate the following: \
* 52WL = 52 week low
* 52WH = 52 week high
* 200SMA
* diff = 52WH - 52WL
* Dist = Close price - 200SMA

**Buy:** When the following conditions are met\
1. (52WL + diff * 0.2) < Close price < (52WL + diff * 0.8)
2. Close price < 200SMA
3. Dist is in the top 5 percentile

**Sell:** At take-profit or stop-loss.
