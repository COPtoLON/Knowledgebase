### Strategy 1 - [link](https://algocraft.xyz/how-to-get-131-return-with-mean-reversion-trading-strategy-from-stock-selection-to-backtesting-c623870adf31)

Calculate the 30-SMA and 30-MSTD of your close prices.
The A-factor has been set to 1%

**Note:** For this strategy 30-SMA = sum(prices(max[0, i - 30]:i) / min(i, 30) \
**Buy:** Close price < 30-SMA[-1] * (1 - A) \
**Sell:** Close price > 30-SMA[-1] * (1 + A)

### Strategy 2 - [link](https://wire.insiderfinance.io/mean-reversion-strategy-using-python-6dfed9ed988c)

For this strategy you should calculate the following: \
* 52-WL = 52 week low
* 52-WH = 52 week high
* 200-SMA
* diff = 52-WH - 52-WL
* Dist = Close price - 200-SMA

**Buy:** When the following conditions are met\
1. (52-WL + diff * 0.2) < Close price < (52-WL + diff * 0.8)
2. Close price < 200-SMA
3. Dist is in the top 5 percentile

**Sell:** At take-profit or stop-loss.

### Strategy 3 - [link](https://eodhd.medium.com/testing-a-powerful-mean-reversion-trading-strategy-using-python-4eb5eed60857)
For this strategy you should calculate the following: \
* 200-SMA
* 10-RSI = NaN

**Buy:** 10-RSI < 30 and Close price > 200-SMA

**Sell:** 10-RSI > 70 and Close price < 200-SMA


### Strategy 4 - [link](https://machinelearning-basics.com/mean-reversion-trading-strategy-using-python/)

For this strategy you should calculate the following: \
* 20-SMA
* 20-MSTD
* diff = Close price - 20-SMA
* Z = diff/20-MSTD

**Buy:** Close price < 20-SMA - 20-MSTD 

**Sell:** Close price > 20-SMA + 20-MSTD 

### Strategy 5 - [link](https://gist.github.com/AnthonyFJGarner/ccd23f0e9d46214612f59c7b92a82149)

This strategy is a trailing purchase.
Whenever the buy signal is triggered, you purchase 1% of your maximum amount.
Whenever slippage happens you sell 1% of your maximum amount.

For this strategy you should calculate the following: \
* 10-SMA
* 100-SMA
* 10-MSTD
* diff = Close price - 10-SMA
* Z = diff/10-MSTD

**Buy:** (Z(i-1) > 0.5 and Z(i) < -0.5) or (Z(i-1) < -0.5 and Z(i) > 0.5)

**Sell:** Z(i) > 1 and 10-SMA < 100-SMA\
Z(i) < -1 and 10-SMA > 100-SMA\
Z(i) < 0.5

### Unoptimized MBZ Strat - Private
* 5-SMA
* 15-SMA
* 30-SMA

**Buy:** \
Close > 5-SMA\
5-SMA < 15-SMA\
15-SMA < 30-SMA\
**Sell:**\
Close > 5-SMA\
5-SMA > 15-SMA\
15-SMA > 30-SMA

### Optimized MBZ Strat - Private
* 5-SMA
* 20-SMA
* 40-SMA

**Buy:** \
Close > 5-SMA\
5-SMA < 20-SMA\
20-SMA < 40-SMA\
**Sell:**\
Close > 5-SMA\
5-SMA > 20-SMA\
20-SMA > 40-SMA

**Note to self**
on short periods it seems 5-15-30 works better.
But on longer periods 5-20-40 works better.
There should be a way to optimized the shift between the two.
Also it is noted that this strategy losses money on dumb situations.
Which could be optimized with a min-max approach.

### Strategy 2 - [link](https://machinelearning-basics.com/mean-reversion-trading-strategy-using-python/)

For this strategy you should calculate the following: \
* Spread in price between asset A and asset B.
* 20-SMA of spread
* 20-MSTD of spread
* diff = Close price - 20-SMA
* Z = diff/20-MSTD

**Buy:** Close price < 20-SMA - k * 20-MSTD 

**Sell:** Close price > 20-SMA + k * 20-MSTD 

Works best when k > 1.5\
