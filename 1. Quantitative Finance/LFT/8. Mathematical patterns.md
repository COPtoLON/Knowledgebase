### Strategy 1 - [link](https://algocraft.xyz/how-to-get-131-return-with-mean-reversion-trading-strategy-from-stock-selection-to-backtesting-c623870adf31)

Calculate the 30-SMA and 30-MSTD of your close prices.
The A-factor has been set to 1%

**Note:** For this strategy 30-SMA = sum(prices(max[0, i - 30]:i) / min(i, 30) \
**Buy:** Close price < 30-SMA[-1] * (1 - A) \
**Sell:** Close price > 30-SMA[-1] * (1 + A)

### Strategy 2 - [link](https://wire.insiderfinance.io/mean-reversion-strategy-using-python-6dfed9ed988c)

For this strategy you should calculate the following: \
* 52-WL = 52 week low
* 52-WH = 52 week high
* 200-SMA
* diff = 52-WH - 52-WL
* Dist = Close price - 200-SMA

**Buy:** When the following conditions are met\
1. (52-WL + diff * 0.2) < Close price < (52-WL + diff * 0.8)
2. Close price < 200-SMA
3. Dist is in the top 5 percentile

**Sell:** At take-profit or stop-loss.

### Strategy 3 - [link](https://eodhd.medium.com/testing-a-powerful-mean-reversion-trading-strategy-using-python-4eb5eed60857)
For this strategy you should calculate the following: \
* 200-SMA
* 10-RSI = 52WH - 52WL

**Buy:** 10-RSI < 30 and Close price > 200-SMA

**Sell:** 10-RSI > 70 and Close price < 200-SMA


### Strategy 4 - [link](https://machinelearning-basics.com/mean-reversion-trading-strategy-using-python/)

For this strategy you should calculate the following: \
* 20-SMA
* 20-MSTD
* diff = Close price - 20-SMA
* Z = diff/20-MSTD

**Buy:** Close price < 20-SMA - 20-MSTD 

**Sell:** Close price > 20-SMA + 20-MSTD

### Strategy 2 - [link](https://machinelearning-basics.com/mean-reversion-trading-strategy-using-python/)

For this strategy you should calculate the following: \
* Spread in price between asset A and asset B.
* 20-SMA of spread
* 20-MSTD of spread
* diff = Close price - 20-SMA
* Z = diff/20-MSTD

**Buy:** Close price < 20-SMA - k * 20-MSTD 

**Sell:** Close price > 20-SMA + k * 20-MSTD 

Works best when k > 1.5\
