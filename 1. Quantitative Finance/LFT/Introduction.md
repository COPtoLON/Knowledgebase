The three axiomatic hypothesis

## Best choices

### Hypothesis on the behaviour of down-trending markets
* Given a down-trending market.
It will be unprofitable to run a long position.
But it will be profitable to run a short position. *

### Hypothesis on the behaviour of flat-trending markets
Given a flat-trending market.
it will be profitable to run long positions on upwards slopes.
For which a sale should occur at a profitable point after a change in direction.
But it will also be profitable to run a short position on downwards slopes.
For which a close of position should occur at a profitable point after a change in direction.
### Hypothesis on the behaviour of up-trending markets
Given an up-trending market.
It will be profitable to run a long position.
But it will be unprofitable to run a short position.

### Hypothesis on the direction reversal effect
Given any market state, reversals of the direction of returns will occur.
The likelihood of a reversal occurring increases as the asset price approaches a “limit”. 
In flat market states, the likelihood of a reversal occurring is significantly higher than in any other market. In approaching an all-time high or an annual high the likelihood increases.

### The extremal event reversal hypothesis
Given any market state and the occurrence of an extremal event.
The likelihood of a reversal occurring increases from above 75% to 97% in step with the size of the extremal outcome and the number of continuous days following the same direction of return as the extremal outcome.

### Hypothesis on the occurrence of spontaneous changes in the direction of returns
Given any market state, spontaneous changes may occur in the direction of returns. 
The reasons for such can vary and even though some reasons are more systematic, changes may occur for the simplest and most irrational of reasons. 
The time horizon of changes taking effect may also vary from minutes to months.
Buffett’s theorem on the intrinsic invariant value of a financial asset
Given an asset and a market state. 
An intrinsic invariant value can be obtained for the asset, given the current market state.
The corresponding value movements will either be approaching- or move in a mean reversion process around the intrinsic invariant value. 

### The bid-ask conundrum
Given any asset, financial or otherwise. 
The bidder holds the objective of buying the asset at the lowest price.
The asker holds the objective of selling the asset at the highest price.
But!
Given a financial market, another complexity is added to this feature.
A bidder may also hold the objective of buying the asset at the lowest price, trending upwards.
While the asker may also hold the objective of selling the asset at the highest price, trending downwards.
Both are looking to minimize risk towards a proposed future event. An up-trending market and a down trending market.

### The supply-demand conundrum

## Market mechanics

### The market participant hypothesis
Given a market with k participants.
The market winner, will be the participant m, whose return is the market maximum after costs.
In this framework, neither risk, probabilities nor time horizons are considered.

### The Second market participant hypothesis
Given a market with k participants.
The market winners, will be the participants m_i through to m_n, whose returns are above market mean after costs.
In this framework, neither risk, probabilities nor time horizons are considered.
The path of least resistance vs the path of least time problem for financial markets
Given a market with k participants.
Each market participant decides at time t = 0, whether to follow a path of least resistance or a path of least time.
After each choice has been made, a success-score will be given to each participant.
	For participants following the path of least resistance, returns will follow a normal distribution, with mean 0 and standard deviation σ_polr
	For participants following the path of least time, returns will follow a normal distribution with mean μ_polt>0 and standard deviation σ_polt>σ_polr.
The market winners will be the participants m_i through to m_n, whose returns are above market mean after costs.
In this framework risk, probabilities and time horizons have been considered.

### The market impact hypothesis
Given a market participant m, if the market volume of m exceeds x% of the market volume within the time horizon [y:z]. Then m runs a risk of affecting the asset price adversely.
To minimize the market impact, m can employ a trailing order.

### The minimal information geometry hypothesis
Given n market participants.
If no trades have occurred from time t = 0 to time t = T. The first trade occurring by participant m, at time t = T+1. Spreads information of m’s supply-demand relationship on the chosen asset.
This information can be used by competitors to gauge possible parasitic trades on m.

### The absolute information geometry hypothesis
Given n market participants.
The trades occurring by participant m, at time t = T. Spreads information of m’s supply-demand relationship on a chosen asset. This information can be used by competitors to gauge possible parasitic trades on m’s position.
	If participant m, buys stock A at time T, then participant m* can buy Stock A at time T+1.
	If participant m, holding Stock A, sells A at time T2, then participant m* can sell stock A at time T2.


## The Signal Theorem.
Given any financial asset, market and time horizon. 
A signal is a proposed repeated pattern occurring given certain conditions, the effect of which is either a certain price movement or adjustment of significant variable.
Signals have varying levels of certainty.
Mathematical signals and fundamental signals can be combined and build into trading strategies.
