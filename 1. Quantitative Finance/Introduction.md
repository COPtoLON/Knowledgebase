# There will be significant changes in the coming months

Over the coming months I will change the layout and structure of this repository.
At the moment, the repository has been structured after subject and resources.
But I will gradually change it to a walk-through of each significant topic.

I will be starting with quantitative finance, specifically walking through work
and examples on quantitative portfolio management, as this has recently become 
desired by others.
