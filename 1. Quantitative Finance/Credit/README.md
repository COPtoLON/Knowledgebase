Credit markets are too illiquid

Hold to maturity

Diversification or hedging to manage risk

YTM(yield to maturity) is invented to compare bonds

fixed coupon to floating

credit spread risk
credit default correlation

Don't correlate yields between bonds
correlate residuals for bonds with stocks in an AR model

DVA is used in XVA, credit risk haircut

There my be correct approach based on counterparty company size
structural model isn't $Z_t = N- E_t (N-A_t)^+$ with $E_t(N-A_t)^+ = DVA$.



normal questions
What is the credit risk of a perpetual zerobond?

what is the default intensity of the firm with a single fixed maturity zerobond?

credit spreads, important?
Moving average is much harder to deal with, non serially correlated is the issue

Vector-ARMA is better, because you can model more spreads, 
determine ARMA n,m visually and multivariate linear regression


On cox process and credit risky bonds, D lando - really good read
hull-white?

SRTs(significiant risk transfers) Are taken into account.
