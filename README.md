# There will be significant changes in the coming months

Over the coming months I will change the layout and structure of this repository.
At the moment, the repository has been structured after subject and resources.
But I will gradually change it to a walk-through of each significant topic.

I will be starting with quantitative finance, specifically walking through work
and examples on quantitative portfolio management, as this has recently become 
desired by others.

**These need working on for quantitative finance**
1. [Blackrock](https://github.com/blackrock) - dig through their repos and find useful algorithms, blogs and documents
2. [Jump Trading](https://github.com/jumptrading) - dig through their repos, look through the CTO's repos
3. [Hudson River Trading](https://github.com/hudson-trading) - look through followers, presumably lots of Hudson employees
4. [Point72](https://github.com/Point72)
5. [AQR Capital Management](https://github.com/aqrcapital)
6. [D. E. Shaw Research](https://github.com/DEShawResearch)
7. [D. E. Shaw Group](https://github.com/deshaw)
8. [Bridgewater associates](https://github.com/Bridgewater) - not much here, try looking through followers
9. [Jane Street](https://github.com/janestreet) - mostly OCaml, but maybe some useful algorithms
10. [Goldman Sachs](https://github.com/goldmansachs) - these guys don't have anything interesting, dig through their followers.
