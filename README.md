## VBA & Excel
For some odd reason, there isn't a lot of VBA code packed up neatly, like with Python, R or C++. So I'll be packaging some of my own solutions at some point.

[VBA tutorial points](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vba/index.htm) One of four webpages I frequent to solve VBA problems or find interesting code for projects.

[Excel-easy](https://www.excel-easy.com/vba.html) This one was shared with me, through the group of student tutors I'm part of at DJÃ˜F.

[Excel champs](https://excelchamps.com/vba/) I use this one for medium level stuff, but it can be a bit difficult to find things here.

[Mr. excel](https://www.mrexcel.com/board/) This one is a forum and it has quite a lot of extra stuff, I usually use it for more difficult stuff.
