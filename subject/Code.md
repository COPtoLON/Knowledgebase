### R

### C++

### SQL
* [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp)

### VBA & Excel
For some odd reason, there isn't a lot of VBA code packed up neatly, like with Python, R or C++. So I'll be packaging some of my own solutions at some point.
* [VBA tutorial points](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vba/index.htm) One of four webpages I frequent to solve VBA problems or find interesting code for projects.
* [Excel-easy](https://www.excel-easy.com/vba.html) This one was shared with me, through the group of student tutors I'm part of at DJÃ˜F.
* [Excel champs](https://excelchamps.com/vba/) I use this one for medium level stuff, but it can be a bit difficult to find things here.
* [Mr. excel](https://www.mrexcel.com/board/) This one is a forum and it has quite a lot of extra stuff, I usually use it for more difficult stuff.
