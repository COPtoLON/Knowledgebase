cumulative volume delta. A relative upward spike in CVD is created when
there is a large increase in buying vs a low amount of selling. A relative downward spike in CVD is created when
there is a large increase in selling vs a low amount of buying.

**VWAP**
How it does it:
1 VWAP Calculation: The script calculates the VWAP using either standard deviation or average deviation over a specified length. It then plots the VWAP and its upper and lower deviation bands.
2 OBV RSI Calculation: It computes the OBV and then calculates the RSI using the cumulative changes in OBV. The RSI is plotted and compared against predefined levels.
3 Table Visibility and Occurrence Counting: It allows the user to display a table showing the number of occurrences where the price is above Upper Dev 2, below Lower Dev 2, crosses above a higher RSI level, or crosses below a lower RSI level.
4 Entries: Long and short entry conditions are defined based on the position of the price relative to the VWAP deviation bands and the color of the OBV RSI. Entries are made when specific conditions are met, and there hasn't been a recent entry.
5 Exit Conditions: The script includes stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. It exits positions based on price crossing the VWAP or a certain percentage, and it prevents further trading after a certain number of consecutive losses.

What traders can use it for:
Trend Identification: Traders can use the VWAP and its deviation bands to identify potential trend reversals or continuations.
Volume Confirmation: The inclusion of OBV RSI provides confirmation of price movements based on volume changes.
Entry and Exit Signals: The script generates buy and sell signals based on the specified conditions, allowing traders to enter and exit positions with defined stop-loss and take-profit levels.
Statistical Analysis: The visibility of occurrence counts in the table allows traders to perform statistical analysis on the frequency of price movements relative to the VWAP and OBV RSI levels.

**MVRV Z-score**

 Strategy, How It Works: Detailed Explanation

The strategy leverages the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score, specifically designed for cryptocurrencies, with a focus on Bitcoin. This metric is crucial for determining whether Bitcoin is currently undervalued or overvalued compared to its historical 'realized' price. Below is an in-depth explanation of the strategy's components and calculations.

🔶Conceptual Foundation

- Market Capitalization (MC): This represents the total dollar market value of Bitcoin's circulating supply. It is calculated as the current price of Bitcoin multiplied by the number of coins in circulation.
- Realized Capitalization (RC): Unlike MC, which values all coins at the current market price, RC is computed by valuing each coin at the price it was last moved or traded. Essentially, it is a summation of the value of all bitcoins, priced at the time they were last transacted.
- MVRV Ratio: This ratio is derived by dividing the Market Capitalization by the Realized Capitalization (The ratio of MC to RC (MVRV Ratio = MC / RC)). A ratio greater than 1 indicates that the current price is higher than the average price at which all bitcoins were purchased, suggesting potential overvaluation. Conversely, a ratio below 1 suggests undervaluation.

🔶 MVRV Z-Score Calculation

The Z-Score is a statistical measure that indicates the number of standard deviations an element is from the mean. For this strategy, the MVRV Z-Score is calculated as follows:

MVRV Z-Score = (MC - RC) / Standard Deviation of (MC - RC)

This formula quantifies Bitcoin's deviation from its 'normal' valuation range, offering insights into market sentiment and potential price reversals.

🔶 Spread Z-Score for Trading Signals

The strategy refines this approach by calculating a 'spread Z-Score', which adjusts the MVRV Z-Score over a specific period (default: 252 days). This is done to smooth out short-term market volatility and focus on longer-term valuation trends. The spread Z-Score is calculated as follows:

Spread Z-Score = (Market Z-Score - MVVR Ratio - SMA of Spread) / Standard Deviation of Spread

Where:
- SMA of Spread is the simple moving average of the spread over the specified period.
- Spread refers to the difference between the Market Z-Score and the MVRV Ratio.

🔶 Trading Signals

- Long Entry Condition: A long (buy) signal is generated when the spread Z-Score crosses above the long entry threshold, indicating that Bitcoin is potentially undervalued.
- Short Entry Condition: A short (sell) signal is triggered when the spread Z-Score falls below the short entry threshold, suggesting overvaluation.

These conditions are based on the premise that extreme deviations from the mean (as indicated by the Z-Score) are likely to revert to the mean over time, presenting opportunities for strategic entry and exit points.

**Leverage sentiment**
█ Strategy, How It Works: Detailed Explanation

🔶 Data Collection and Ratio Calculation

Firstly, the strategy acquires data on leveraged long (**`priceLongs`**) and short positions (**`priceShorts`**) for Bitcoin. The primary metric of interest is the ratio of long positions relative to the total of both long and short positions:

BTC Ratio=priceLongs / (priceLongs+priceShorts)

This ratio reflects the prevailing market sentiment, where values closer to 1 indicate a bullish sentiment (dominance of long positions), and values closer to 0 suggest bearish sentiment (prevalence of short positions).

🔶 Z-Score Calculation

The Z-Score is then calculated to standardize the BTC Ratio, allowing for comparison across different time periods. The Z-Score formula is:

Z = (X - μ) / σ

Where:

- X is the current BTC Ratio.
- μ is the mean of the BTC Ratio over a specified period (**`zScoreCalculationPeriod`**).
- σ is the standard deviation of the BTC Ratio over the same period.

The Z-Score helps quantify how far the current sentiment deviates from the historical norm, with high positive values indicating extreme bullish sentiment and high negative values signaling extreme bearish sentiment.

🔶 Signal Generation: Trading signals are derived from the Z-Score as follows:

Long Entry Signal: Occurs when the BTC Ratio Z-Score crosses above the thresholdLongEntry, suggesting bullish sentiment.
- Condition for Long Entry = BTC Ratio Z-Score > thresholdLongEntry

Long Exit/Short Entry Signal: Triggered when the BTC Ratio Z-Score drops below thresholdLongExit for exiting longs or below thresholdShortEntry for entering shorts, indicating a shift to bearish sentiment.
- Condition for Long Exit/Short Entry = BTC Ratio Z-Score < thresholdLongExit or BTC Ratio Z-Score < thresholdShortEntry

Short Exit Signal: Happens when the BTC Ratio Z-Score exceeds the thresholdShortExit, hinting at reducing bearish sentiment and a potential switch to bullish conditions.
- Condition for Short Exit = BTC Ratio Z-Score > thresholdShortExit

🔶Implementation and Visualization: The strategy applies these conditions for trade management, aligning with the selected trade direction. It visualizes the BTC Ratio Z-Score with horizontal lines at entry and exit thresholds, illustrating the current sentiment against historical norms.




**Sentiment analysis**
what's the sentiment on an asset.

**Risk-on/Risk-off**
monitor investors risk tolerance wrt response on economic patterns.
low risk periods = higher risk investments and reverse.
monitor actions and statements by central banks.
macroeconomic data, corporate earnings and others.
estimate whether market risk sentiment is high or low

**inverse volatility**
this is about hedging against portfolio risk, by gaining exposure to volatility.
An inverse volatility ETF bets on market stability. 
Use CBOE volatility index(VIX).
When an ETFS benchmark volatility rises, it loses value. Using this to monitor an ETFs volatility.
Using an ETF's volatility on VIX can help automate buy and sell orders to limit losses and maximize gains.

**Black Swan Catchers**
whenever an unpredictable event happens. Such as the financial crisis and covid.
Leverage the intense market volatility following such an event. It's to hook yourself up to options/futures and very speculative markets when such events occur.


**Arbitrage**
Not possible at the moment
