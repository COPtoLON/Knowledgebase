# Interview questions

An ant leaves its anthill in order to forage for food. It moves with the speed of 10cm per second, but it doesn't know where to go, therefore every second it moves randomly 10cm directly north, south, east or west with equal probability.\
- If the food is located on east-west lines 20cm to the north and 20cm to the south, as well as on north-south lines 20cm to the east and 20cm to the west from the anthill, how long will it take the ant to reach it on average?\
- What is the average time the ant will reach food if it is located only on a diagonal line passing through (10cm, 0cm) and (0cm, 10cm) points?\
- Can you write a program that comes up with an estimate of average time to find food for any closed boundary around the anthill? What would be the answer if food is located outside an defined by ( (x – 2.5cm) / 30cm )2 + ( (y – 2.5cm) / 40cm )2 < 1 in coordinate system where the anthill is located at (x = 0cm, y = 0cm)? Provide us with a solution rounded to the nearest integer.\

\

1) What would you pay to play a game where you receive what ever number is on a rolled die in dollars (so if you roll a 6, you receive $6)?\
2) What if you can re-roll it if you don't like the number? If you can re-roll twice?\
3) Write a program that calculates the expected value of this game with n re-rolls and s sides to the die.\
4) Can you make the space with respect to n sub-linear?\




For a 3 sets tennis game, would you bet on it finishing in 2 sets or 3 sets?
I have a square, and place three dots along the 4 edges at random. What is the probability that the dots lie on distinct edges?
You have 10 people in a room. How many total handshakes if they all shake hands?
Two decks of cards. One deck has 52 cards, the other has 104. You pick two cards separately from a same pack. If both of two cards are red, you win. Which pack will you choose?
What is 39*41?
A group of people wants to determine their average salary on the condition that no individual would be able to find out anyone else's salary. Can they accomplish this, and, if so, how?
How many digits are in 99 to the 99th power?
A line of 100 passengers is waiting to board a plane. They each hold a ticket to one of the 100 seats on that flight. (For convenience, let's say that the nth passenger in line has a ticket for the seat number n.) Unfortunately, the first person in line is crazy, and will ignore the seat number on their ticket, picking a random seat to occupy. All of the other passengers are quite normal, and will go to their proper seat unless it is already occupied. If it is occupied, they will then find a free seat to sit in, at random. What is the probability that the last (100th) person to board the plane will sit in their proper seat (#100)?
What is the sum of the numbers one to 100?
You have a 3 gallon jug and 5 gallon jug, how do you measure out exactly 4 gallons? Is this possible?
You have 17 coins and I have 16 coins, we flip all coins at the same time. If you have more heads then you win, if we have the same number of heads or if you have less then I win. What's your probability of winning?
What is the probability you draw two cards of the same color from a standard 52-card deck? You are drawing without replacement.
You’re in a room with three light switches, each of which controls one of three light bulbs in the next room. You need to determine which switch controls which bulb. All lights are off to begin, and you can’t see into one room from the other. You can inspect the other room only once. How can you find out which switches are connected to which bulbs? Is this possible?
In world series, what are the odds it goes 7 games if each team equal chance of winning?
Given 100 coin flips, what is the probability that you get an even number of heads?
There are 5 balls, 3 red, and 2 black. What is the probability that a random ordering of the 5 balls does not have the 2 black balls next to each other?
What is the least multiple of 15 whose digits consist only of 1's and 0's?
Is 1027 a prime number?
Does the price of a call option increase when volatility increases?
2 blue and 2 red balls, in a box, no replacing. Guess the color of the ball, you receive a dollar if you are correct. What is the dollar amount you would pay to play this game?
What is the singles digit for 2^230?

Answers:
Two sets - Let p=prob team 1 wins and q=prob team 2 wins. p^2 + q^2 = probability finish in two sets. 2*p*q = probability finish in three sets. p^2 + q^2 always >= 2*p*q, so the answer is two sets.
3/8 - Given the edge the first dot is on, the probability the other two dots are on distinct edges is (3/4)*(2/4)
45 - (10 choose 2) = 45 -- this is the total number of ways two people can shake hands.
104 card pack - (52/104)*(51/103) > (26/52)*(25/51), or 51/103 > 25/51
1599 - 39*41 = (40-1)*(40+1) = 40*40 - 1 = 1599
Yes, it’s possible - The first person thinks of a random number, say X. This person adds this number to her salary. The rest of the group simply adds their salary to the initial number. Then, the first person subtracts the random number X and divides the total salary sum by the size of the group to obtain the average.
198 - 99^99 = (100)^(99) * (.99)^99 = (10)^(198) * (.99)^99. You can convince yourself 10^198 has 199 digits, and 0.99^.99 approaches 1/e. Thus, (10)^(198) * (.99)^99 has 198 digits.
0.5 - The fate of the last passenger is determined the second either the first or last seat on the plane is taken. This statement is true because the last person will either get the first seat or the last seat. All other seats will necessarily be taken by the time the last passenger gets to pick his/her seat. Since at each choice step, the first or last seat has an equal probability of being taken, the last person will get either the first or last with equal probability: 0.5.
5050 - Sum of numbers from 1,2....n = n*(n+1)/2. You can also think about this problem by pairing off numbers - 1 and 100, 2 and 99, 3 and 98, 4 and 97, etc. We have 50 of these pairs, and each pair sums up to 101, so the final sum = 50*101 = 5050.
Yes, it’s possible - Fill up the 3 gallon jug. Then, pour the liquid into the 5 gallon jug. Fill the 3 gallon jug again, and then fill the 5 gallon jug until it is full. We now have 1 gallon remaining in the 3 gallon jug. We empty the five gallon jug and pour the remaining 1 gallon into our 5 gallon jug. Finally, we fill the 3 gallon jug and add this to the 5 gallon jug (which already had 1 gallon). We are left with 4 gallons in the 5 gallon jug.
0.5 - Use recursion - The initial 16 flips have the same probability of everything. Thus, the game completely depends on if the last coin flip is tails or head (50/50 chance of H vs. T).
25/51 - You either draw a black or a red card first. Then, there are 51 cards left in the deck and 25 of these cards have the same color. Thus, the probability is 25/51.
Yes, it’s possible - Leave switch 1 off. Then, turn switch 2 on for ten minutes. After the ten minutes, turn it off and quickly turn on switch 3. Now, go into the room. The currently lit up bulb connects to switch 3. The bulb that off but still warm is from switch 2, and the remaining bulb is from switch 1.
20/64 - Out of the first three games, each team needs to win three. Thus, (6 choose 3)*(.5^6) = 20/64, as each team has a 1/2 probability of winning each game.
1/2 - Whether there is an odd or even number of heads is ultimately determined by the final flip (50/50 chance of being heads vs. tails), for any number of flips.
0.6 - Because of repeats of black/red balls, there are 10 combinations of red/black balls: (5 choose 2) or (5 choose 3) spots to put the black or red balls, respectively. There are 4 places that 2 black balls can be next to each other, so the other 6 combinations do NOT have two black balls next to each other.
1110 - The last digit must be zero (30, 45, 60, 75, etc.). Multiples of 15 never end in 1. Then, starting checking numbers. 10, 100, 110, 1000, 1100, 1110. You will quickly arrive at the answer if you are good with your mental math.
No - 1027 = 1000 + 27 = 10^3 + 3^3. We know a^3 + b^3 can be factored, so 1027 is NOT prime.
Yes - sometimes a rare finance question is included in these interviews; remember that both time and volatility increase the prices of both calls and puts
17/6 dollars - You’ll always get the last ball right as your sampling w/o replacement. The first ball you have a 50% chance of getting right. The second ball you have a 2/3 chance of getting right.
4 - Repeating patterns -- 2,4,8,6,2 -- follow the pattern.



Pre-Interview
(Ten minutes)

1) Mental Math: One million minus one hundred eleven.
2) Mental Math: Fifty-four percent of one hundred ten.
3) Game: With one die, suppose in a round, you earn the amount of dollars equal to the value of the upwards face of the die. (eg. you earn $6 if you roll a six.) Now also suppose after your first roll, you are given the opportunity to cancel your first and roll again, taking that value as the final value. What should your strategy be?
4) What's the closest integer to the square root of 1420.
5) You and a roommate are hosting a party. You invite 10 other pairs of roommates. During the party you poll everyone at the party (excluding yourself) and ask how many hands each person shook. Two conditions:
a) Each person did not shake his roommate's hand.
b) Each person shook a different number of hands.
Question: How many hands did you roommate shake?
6) a) You roll a die, and are given an amount in dollar equal to the number on the die. What would you pay to play this game if you played it a lot of times?
b) now say that when you roll the die, you're allowed to either take the money that you'd get with the roll, or roll a second time; if you roll a second time, you're obligated to take the number of dollars that you get with the second roll. Now what is the worth of the game?
c) Same thing as above, except you have an option to play the game a third time.

Interview
(Thirty minutes)

1) Suppose you are given the opportunity to bid for a treasure chest, which you know with 100% confidence to be priced anywhere between $0-$1000. If you bid equal to or above the price, you win the treasure chest (at the cost of your bid). If you bid below the price, you do not earn the treasure chest. Now, also suppose you have a friend who is willing to buy the treasure chest from you for one and a half times the price of the treasure chest (should you obtain the chest). What should your bid be?

2) In Baseball, the batting average is the number of hits over the number of at bats. Player A has a greater batting average than Player B in the first half of the season and the second half of the season. Is it possible that Player B would have a higher batting average for the entire season?

3) How much calories does a Big Mac have? Would you bet $1 on it? How about $10?

4) How many tons does the ocean weigh?

5) How much would you be willing to bet on it being within 25% of that at even odds?

6) A company has a value V which is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. you are planning to place a bid B for the company. If B is smaller than V, then your bid loses and you get nothing; if B is larger than V, you get to purchase the company at price B, and the company will end up being worth 1.5 * V. What price B should you bid to maximize your profit?

7) On a sheet of paper, you have 100 statements written down. the first says, "at most 0 of these 100 statements are true." the second says, "at most 1 of these 100 statements are true." ... the nth says, "at most (n-1) of these 100 statements are true. ... the 100th says, "at most 99 of these statements are true." how many of the statements are true?

8) You have two decks of cards: one has 13 reds and 13 blacks, and the other has 26 reds and 26 blacks. We play a game in which you select one of the two decks, and pick two cards from it; you win the game if you select two black cards. Which deck should you select to maximize your chances of winning? Try to do this problem in your head, without writing any calculations down.

9) You have a deck of 52 cards, and you keep taking pairs of cards out of the deck. if a pair of cards are both red, then you win that pair; if a pair of cards are both black, then I win that pair; if a pair of cards has one red and one black, then it's discarded. If, after going through the whole deck, you have more pairs than I do, then you win $1, and if I have more pairs than you do, I win $1. What is the value of this game in the long run?
