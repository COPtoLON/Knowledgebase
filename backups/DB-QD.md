--------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Understanding
I've been led to understand that the Quant Dev position in Deutsche bank's Group strategic analytics department works on building models for FRTB specifically market risk. 
So the obvious considerations would be to consider what risk measures would be useful for Deutsche Bank, such as VaR, CVaR, Expected shortfall, Stress testing and what capital requirements there are. *economic‑capital engines*

I've come to understand that GSA uses Python/C++ to build their risk platform. Which I would be comfortable with, having already worked in both for my own project and for LD Pensions, Lån&Spar Bank and Denmarks statistics - distributed calculation platform that feed daily capital numbers and trader dashboards.

I've also come to understand That DB is in the process of a FRTB rollout and must prove model accuracy, P&L attribution and risk‑factor eligibility to regulators.

### 2.Evidence
**Highlight concrete evidence you can ship production-grade risk code and debug it in live environments**

- I'm a Quant developer with approximately 4 yrs experience.
- I've primarily used Python, Excel and SQL, with work done in C++, R and SAS with NoSQL
- I've worked on topics such as; Risk & stress-testing engines With both Monte‑Carlo and parametric designs.
  - for risk measurements in FX, Crypto and equity
  - decomposed spot-rates & forwards into curve/vol factors
- I've recently migrated to London and am looking to apply my risk‑engine know‑how at scale within DB GSA Market‑Risk Strats.
- productionised risk dashboards with automated regression tests.
- I thrive at the intersection of quant, risk and DevOps—exactly what Market‑Risk Strats needs for the FRTB and stress‑testing build‑out.”

### 3. Questions
- I apologize, but out of curiosity, why has this same position been posted repeatedly over the past couple of weeks?
