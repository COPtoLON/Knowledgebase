Work Experience 
Founder, Quantitative Researcher and Developer 
TMRW | Remote | January 2021 – Present 
Founded and led development of a comprehensive algorithmic trading platform (“TMRW”) 
integrating advanced quantitative modeling, AI-driven market analysis, and live trading 
execution. Incorporated theoretical innovations such as an extended geometric-information 
framework for multi-agent market dynamics into practical machine learning and reinforcement 
learning strategies, deploying both ultra-low-latency and mid-frequency trading systems. 
Achieved notable results including a ~13% return in a short-term live trading deployment and a 
top 0.5% ranking (#107/12,000) in the IMC Prosperity 3 global quantitative trading challenge. 
• Theoretical Research: Developed an extended geometric-information framework for 
market modeling, blending physics (differential geometry) with game theory to treat the 
market as a dynamic geometric field of interacting agents. This novel approach 
formalized trading strategies as hybrid geometric-information flows, providing a rigorous 
foundation for adaptive, multi-scale trading systems. 
• Regime Detection & Strategy Allocation: Designed advanced market-state detection 
algorithms using multi-model classifiers – including physics-informed turbulence 
metrics, Hidden Markov Models, decision trees, and stationarity tests – to identify 
regime shifts in real time. Built an AI-driven strategy engine that dynamically switches 
between trend-following, mean-reversion, and event-driven strategies based on 
detected market regimes and volatility forecasts, enabling the portfolio to continuously 
adapt to changing market conditions. 
• Machine Learning & RL Strategies: Developed and deployed trading algorithms across 
multiple time horizons – from ultra-low latency market-making and arbitrage bots 
(microsecond-to-millisecond reaction times) to mid-frequency momentum and 
statistical arbitrage models using stochastic control and actor–critic reinforcement 
learning, and even macro-scale portfolio optimizations via mean-field game theory. This 
multi-scale approach ensured strategy robustness from high-frequency settings up to 
longer-term market regimes. 
• Infrastructure & Execution: Engineered a scalable research-to-execution infrastructure 
with high-performance backtesting and real-time data pipelines (streaming multi-asset 
order books, options, and news feeds). Integrated trading execution across major 
exchanges – Binance, Coinbase, OKX, Robinhood, etc. – via low-latency APIs, 
achieving sub-second order execution and embedding automated risk management 
(dynamic position sizing, VaR/CVaR limits) for live trading. 
• Performance & Achievements: Achieved a ~13% return in an initial live trading 
deployment of TMRW’s strategies. Earned a top 0.5% global rank (107th out of ~12,000 
participants) in the IMC Prosperity 3 algorithmic trading challenge, validating the 
strategies against international competition. Incorporated the winning market-making 
(Avellaneda-Stoikov with drift) and statistical arbitrage techniques from this competition 
back into TMRW’s live trading framework to further enhance performance.
