Options, Futures, and other derivatives
Options Type
Typically, options have two different types:
a. Call Option
Call option means a contract that extends the right to buy underlying at a specific price within a specified date
b. Put Option
Put option is also a contract that extends the right to sell underlying at a specific price within a specified date.
Strike Price
Strike price means a price at which both buyers and sellers of the Option agree to execute a contract. When the options price goes beyond the strike price, the options trade turns out to be profitable.
In-The-Money or ITM
In-the-Money ATM is considered when the call option’s strike price is a smaller amount compared to the present market value.
Conversely, the put option is the In-The-Money ATM if the current market price is less than the stock price.
At-The-Money or ATM
At-The-Money or ATM defines a situation wherein the strike price of a put or a call option is equivalent to the current market price of an underlying asset.
Over-The-Money or OTM
Over-The-Money is considered when the strike price is more than the current market price of an underlying asset.
Similarly, on the other hand, if the strike price is lower than the current market price of an underlying asset, then the put option is said to be at OTM.
Open Interest or OI
Open Interest means the Interest of traders during a specific strike price. The higher the amount, the Interest will be more among the traders for the actual strike price of an option. Since there’s more Interest among traders, there will be high liquidity to trade your opinion.
Change in Open Interest
It shows all the significant changes taken place in the Open Interest before the expiration date. The significant difference in OI signifies that either contracts are closed, exercised, or squared off.
Volume
The volume shows the trader's interest, and the total number of contracts of an option for a specific price traded within the market.
Volume is calculated daily and can even help understand the current Interest of several traders.
Implied Volatility or IV
Implied Volatility showed the price swing. High Implied volatility means there will be a high swing in prices, and low implied Volatility means there will be few or low swings in prices.
Last Traded Option or LTP
LTP means the last traded price of an option.
Bid Price
Bid Price means the actual value quoted within the last buy order. A price above the Last Traded Price (LTP) may indicate rising demand for options.
Bid Quantity
Bid Quantity is the total number of buy orders booked for a particular strike price. However, it tells you about the current demand for the strike price of an option.
Ask Quantity
Ask Quantity is the total number of open sell orders for a particular strike price. It indicates the availability of the options.
Ask Price
Ask Price is the value quotes within the last sell order.

Portfolio management & optimization

Portfolio framework

# Portfolio management & optimization

## Portfolio framework
π=(p_1,p_2,p_3,…,p_n ) which has portfolio weights on the n different assets.\
R=(r_1,r_2,r_3,…,r_n) which has the portfolio returns on the n different assets.\ 
Portfolio values\
If one wishes to calculate a value, such as returns, means, standard deviations or perhaps Alpha or Beta. To aggregate these values from asset to portfolio level, one would have to use the following aggregation method.\
$x_\pi = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \pi_i \cdot X_i$\
Where X can be replaces with another symbol to represent the desired value.
An example is return.\
$R_\pi = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \pi_i \cdot R_i$\
Where as represented in the framework, π_i represents the I’th portfolio weight and R_i represents the I’th return. In this same way one would get.\
$\sigma_\pi = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \pi_i \cdot \sigma_i$\
This calculation will either require you to have another vector σ=(σ_1,σ_2,σ_3,…,σ_n) with standard deviations, or a vector of time series of returns for each n assets in your portfolio. \
